\section{Plan}

The plan is to first modify the Efros Leung algorithm from Homework 2. Then, we will write the PatchMatch algorithm. Then, we will do benchmarking of the two algorithms on our dataset. If time permits, we may test on a video or implement the Ashikhmin algorithm.

As of now, the team only has one member, so the work will not be split. If more members join the team, perhaps one additional algorithm will be assigned to each team member. In that case, the code will be shared on GitHub, as will the reports.

The code will be written with Python, and the reports will be written with \LaTeX~following the CVPR style.

The modification of the Efros Leung algorithm and the finishing of the PatchMatch algorithm are top priority for being finished prior to the presentation date. It is possible that the comparison will not be done at that time, as the Efros Leung algorithm may be extremely slow to test.
