\section{Plan}

The plan is to first modify the Efros Leung algorithm from Homework 2. Then, we will write the PatchMatch algorithm. Then, we will do benchmarking of the two algorithms on our dataset. If time permits, we may test on a video or implement the Ashikhmin algorithm.

Since the team has two members, the work will be split evenly. If we determine that the work that PatchMatch requires is sufficient one person, then we will also implement the Ashikhmin algorithm. Code and reports are shared through a github repository. The code will be written with Python, and the reports will be written with \LaTeX~following the CVPR style.

The modification of the Efros Leung algorithm and the finishing of the PatchMatch algorithm are top priority for being finished prior to the presentation date. It is possible that the comparison will not be done at that time, as the Efros Leung algorithm may be extremely slow to test.
